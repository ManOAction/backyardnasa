#Description

Don't forget.  We're using this tutorial to get started.

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing/3

We're also using pipenv to manage dependencies.

Current board is loaded up on a Pi B+
pi@192.168.122.195 was the last known location
-u pi -p raspberry



# Dependencies
pipenv # Use pipenv shell to activate the environment.

# rover
gpiozero  # Used to handle the GPIO pins.

# twitterbot


#TODO

We have it running in simple patterns and looping through a rover command interface.

We need to add eyes so it learns object avoidance.

Also get twitter bot up and running.
